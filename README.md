Hi 

I have not integrated the text highlighting algorithms into the app as it is not clear from the assignment which is criteria or context for the higlighting

You can go through the file DocumentViewer.tsx I have included the comments where we can include any of the algorithm and how to highlight the results from the algorithm

For now I have included a text field on top of the document viewer in the web page where you can enter any text which will be highlighted in the document viewer.

In the similar way we can highlight the results from the algorithm by passing the results from the alogrithm to the document viewer.



## Run the application

Step1 : Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/Sasidhar9293/search-text-highlighter.git
Step2 : Navigate the project directory search-text-highlighter
In the project directory, you can run:
Step3 : run the command  [npm install] - to install all the required npm packages
On successful installation of node packages
Step4 : run [npm start] - to start the application 


Application will launch a browser and  load a document viewer  and a text field 
the document viewer will load the document included in the public folder paform.pdf.(you can change the document place the document of your interest)

You can enter text in the text field to get the text highlighed in the document viewer
